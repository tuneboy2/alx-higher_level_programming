# Higher-Level Programming - Python
This repository contains programs written for the higher-level programming track at ALX Africa. In these projects, which began in  the fourth month of the one year curriculum, the major language learnt is Python whilst subsequently reinforcing and expanding my skills in C and shell scripting. The specific list of projects contained are as follows:
- [0x00. Python - Hello, World](https://github.com/tuneboy2/alx-higher_level_programming/tree/master/0x00-python-hello_world)
- [0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions](https://github.com/tuneboy2/alx-higher_level_programming/tree/master/0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions)
- [0x02. Python - import & modules](https://github.com/tuneboy2/alx-higher_level_programming/tree/master/0x02-python-import_modules)
- [0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples](https://github.com/tuneboy2/alx-higher_level_programming/tree/master/0x03-python-data_structures)
