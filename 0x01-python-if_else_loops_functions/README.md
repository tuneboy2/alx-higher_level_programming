# Python - if/else, loops, functions
In this project, I learnt about the various control flow tools available in python. I utilized the conditionals and loops like `if`, `if ... else`, `break`, `continue` and `range` statements with `while` and `for` in loops. I also started defining my own functions amidst other learning based activities.
